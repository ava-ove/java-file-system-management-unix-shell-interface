b) [carried over] As a user, I can get back an audible form of what I typed so that I can hear my input. (Speak) 
c) As a user, I can see all the contents (file or directory) in the directory I am currently in so that I am aware of the contents of the directory I amm in. (ls)
d) As a user, I can see all the contents (file or directory) of any directory that I give a path for so that I am aware of the contents of the directory I give. (ls)
e) As a user, I can see the name of a specific file that I give a path to so that I can easily access the file name. (ls)
f) As a user, I can create a new directory so that there exists a desired directory wherever I specify it. (mkdir) 
g) As a user, I can see the history of all my input in order so that I am aware of previous commands (history)
h) As a user, I can specify the number of previous inputs I want to see so that I can see the most recent inputs. (history)
i) As a user, I can see the documentation for the program so that I can understand how the program works. (man cmd)
j) As a user, I can see the directory I am currently working in so that I know which directory I am in. (pwd) 
k) As a user, I can go to the parent directory without giving a full path so that I can conveniently navigate up in directories. (cd)
