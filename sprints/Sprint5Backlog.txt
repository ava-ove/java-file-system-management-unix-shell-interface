Sprint 5 Backlog 
July 24 - August 2

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I can add a file from a specified URL in my current working directory so that I can easily access a file from the Internet in my working directory. (curl)
b) As a user, I can start from where I left off from a previous session, at the beginning of the current session, so that I can resume working where I left off. (load)
c) As a user, I can search for a file in the directory/directories that I specify so that I can know if it exists in the specified locations. (find)
d) As a user, I can search for a directory in the directory/directories that I specify so that I can know of all existing directories with that name. (find)
e) As a user, I can append all information output by a command in an existing file instead of seeing the result in Shell, so that the information is saved in a 
desired file. 
f) As a user, I can overwrite all contents of an existing file with the information returned by command instead of seeing the result in Shell, so that the information 
is stored in a desired file. 
g) As a user, I can store all contents returned by command into a new file instead of seeing the result in Shell, so that the information is stored in a desired file.
